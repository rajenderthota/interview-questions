### ðŸ”¹ **Core Java 8 Concepts**

#### âœ… Lambda Expressions
1. **What is a lambda expression in Java 8? How is it different from anonymous classes?**
2. **How does the compiler infer types in lambda expressions?**
3. **Can lambda expressions access local variables? Explain "effectively final".**

#### âœ… Functional Interfaces
4. **What is a functional interface? How is it identified?**
5. **What are some commonly used functional interfaces in Java 8?**
6. **Can a functional interface have default or static methods?**

#### âœ… Method & Constructor References
7. **What are method references? Explain different types with examples.**
8. **When would you use a constructor reference instead of a lambda?**

### ðŸ”¹ **Streams API**

#### âœ… Basic Stream Concepts
9. **What is a stream in Java 8? How is it different from a collection?**
10. **Explain the difference between `map`, `flatMap`, and `filter`.**
11. **Whatâ€™s the difference between intermediate and terminal operations?**
12. **Is a stream reusable? If not, how can you reuse its source?**
13. **How does lazy evaluation work in Java Streams?**

#### âœ… Advanced Stream Use Cases
14. **Whatâ€™s the difference between `reduce` and `collect` in streams?**
15. **How would you group data in a stream (e.g., using `Collectors.groupingBy`)?**
16. **How to calculate averages, sum, or statistics using streams?**
17. **Whatâ€™s the performance impact of using streams vs traditional loops?**

#### âœ… Parallel Streams
18. **What are parallel streams? When should or shouldnâ€™t you use them?**
19. **How do parallel streams internally work? What thread pool do they use?**
20. **How would you make a custom collector to work with parallel streams?**

### ðŸ”¹ **Date and Time API (java.time)**

21. **What are the main classes in Java 8's Date and Time API?**
22. **How is `LocalDate` different from `ZonedDateTime` and `Instant`?**
23. **How would you calculate the difference between two dates?**
24. **How do you convert between `java.util.Date` and `java.time.LocalDate`?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Optional Class**

25. **What is `Optional` in Java 8? Why is it introduced?**
26. **Whatâ€™s the difference between `orElse()`, `orElseGet()`, and `orElseThrow()`?**
27. **What are best practices for using Optional in method parameters and return types?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**

28. **Why were default methods introduced in Java 8?**
29. **Can you override a default method in a class?**
30. **What happens in case of multiple inheritance conflict (e.g., two interfaces with the same default method)?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Practical/Scenario-Based**

31. **Write a stream pipeline to find the first non-repeated character in a string.**
32. **Use Java 8 features to group employees by department and calculate average salary.**
33. **Given a list of transactions, find the highest transaction per customer.**
34. **How would you use `Optional` to avoid `NullPointerException` in nested property access?**
35. **Implement a retry logic using lambdas or functional interfaces.**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Bonus: Design/Architecture Qs involving Java 8**

36. **Where have you used Java 8 features in system design or microservices?**
37. **How would Java 8 help improve readability and testability of code?**
38. **How do you decide between using imperative style vs functional style in production code?**
